# RP235x Examples

These examples were validated against a [Pico 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/) with the
[Adafruit MPRLS](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3965) breakout board. For different hardware combinations, it's
important to verify both the pin mappings and serial interface.

## Usage
E.g. `$ cargo run --bin i2c_async_status`
